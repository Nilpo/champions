        "description": "Spider-Gwen enters the fight in either Hunter Spider or Trap Spider mode.\n\nWhile in Hunter Spider Mode, Gwen focuses her senses to strike at enemy weak points, allowing her attacks a 16% chance to Armor Break foes, lowering their Armor by 4% for 7 seconds. Gwen’s Hunter Spider Mode Armor Break stacks infinitely.\n\nWhile in Trap Spider Mode, Gwen readies herself to ensnare enemies. While charging her Heavy attack, she ignores the first attack against her and gains one charge of Precision, increasing her Critical Hit Rate by 21% for her next attack.",
        "note": "Gwen’s Trap Spider Mode rewards players who can get the timing correct, allowing players to interrupt combos and strike for a large Critical Boosted attack.",
