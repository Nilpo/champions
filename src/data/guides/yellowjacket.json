        "note": "Yellowjacket is designed to bait special attacks.  Your goal should be to ramp up the enemy power level to L1 or L2, and hit him with your own L1 or L2.  Use the walk-up/run-away method to bait enemy special attacks and evade. The Power Sting target will take damage at the beginning of the L1 or L2 animation, and at the end of the L3 animation.  \n\nIf Yellowjacket is awakened, investing in Utility Masteries will extend the stun duration and related effects.  Awakened or not, investing in masteries that raise your base attack will increase the direct damage dealt to the target.",
